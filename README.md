# py_vp9
Script to encode high efficiency video for web, using ffmpeg and libvpx. Manipulate `settings.yaml` instead of the CLI.

Requires ffmpeg to be installed and in your `PATH`.

### Usage

```
pip install pyyaml
python encode.py
```

## Example settings file

```

### Features:
- _File_: Transcode a single input video to vp9
	- Default crf: 30
- _Batch_: Transcode a single input video to multiple quality option thresholds based on settings (Batch mode)
	- Default crf values: 50, 30, 20, 12, 8 (it may be preferable to use crf 4 or lower for exceptional IQ)


### Encoding settings:
- Two-pass.
- Optional downscaling by integer with lanczos (`1280x920` -> `640x480`).
- libvpx-vp9 encoding. From the [ffmpeg docs](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/VP9):
  >libvpx-vp9 can save about 20â€“50% bitrate compared to libx264 (the default H.264 encoder), while retaining the same visual quality.
- Variable bitrate switch `-b:v` is set to 0, because the high quality use case prefers that image quality is not variable.
- Constant rate factor switch `-crf` is set by the user to achieve the desired consistent image quality across the length of the video. Good defaults are between 8 and 30, but more research is needed.

### Coming soon
- AV1 encoding with rav1e
- `Folder` mode: Transcode all items inside a single folder, with or without batch mode.
- `-deadline` and `-cpu-used` arguments to further optimize IQ
